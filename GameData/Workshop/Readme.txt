OSE Workshop Continued by Aelfhe1m - developed from original mod OSE Workshop by ObiVanDamme

What does it do?

The OSE - Workshop is a new Part that is meant to be used together with Kerbal Inventory System (KIS). It allows you to create parts in flight.

Current Features

    Queueing of items for production
    All Items require MaterialKits, ElectricCharge and a crew of two Kerbals to be created
    The amount of MaterialKits needed is depending on the mass of the created item => To create an item with the mass of one ton you need one ton of MaterialKits (not one unit)
	Third party mods may add or change required resources to make some parts (recipes)
    Recycling of items stored in your vessels inventory
    Processing of Ore into MaterialParts
    Pause and cancel current production

Installation

	Download and install the pre-requisites: Module Manager, Kerbal Inventory System (KIS), Community Resource Pack and FirespitterCore
	Merge the GameData folder from the OSE Workshop download with your KSP GameData folder.
	
Upgrades
	When upgrading from a previous version of OSE Workshop it is recommended that you delete the old GameData/Workshop folder before installing the new version.
